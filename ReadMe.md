## SYNOPSIS

``` cpp

        throws([&] {
            std::bitset<5> mybitset(std::string("01234"));
        }, "bitset takes only bits");

## DESCRIPTION

This library consists of a single header `tappp.hpp` which implements an
object-oriented [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/) producer
in C++17. For convenience, a procedural interface is written on top, which
becomes nice to use once you are `using namespace TAP`.

The library is short and completely documented in the source code.
Its interface is close to Perl's [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More)
and Raku's [Test](https://docs.raku.org/type/Test) modules.
There are other C++ libraries of this kind. The author is aware of
[libperl++](https://github.com/Leont/libperl--) and
[libtap++](https://github.com/cbab/libtappp), the latter being a fork
of the former and this library taking inspiration from both.
I wouldn't have written this library if there weren't things to improve
in the existing ones, though. The advantages of `tappp.hpp` shared with
`libtap++` over `libperl++` are:

- The TAP producer is isolated into a single library.
- There is no compile-time boost dependency. Just pure C++17.

What I consider to be unique advantages over `libtap++`:

- `tappp.hpp` is just a single header, easy to include in projects.ยน
- It has been (cleanly!) written from scratch to use modern C++ features.
- It supports subtests as a compatible TAP extension.

ยน The test suite is compiled and run either by maintainers or on installation
of the software you care about. If the tests pass, they are thrown away and
the software is installed. As such, having a compile-time dependency on a
full-blown shared library for producing TAP seems like overkill to me.

## TODO

The feature set of this library is already quite what I imagined, but other
TAP producers, such as [Raku's Test module](https://docs.raku.org/type/Test)
provide inspiration for more:

- `is_approx`: testing relative error for numerics
- `is_deeply`: recursive container unpacking
